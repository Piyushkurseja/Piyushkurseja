I am a dedicated student of Computer Science, specializing in computer organization and architecture. My focus includes control unit design, parallel processing systems based on Flynn's classification, and pipeline stages. I enjoy exploring topics such as Von-Neumann and Harvard architectures, as well as the details of the IEEE-754 standard.

I am a lifelong learner with a solid background in computer science and mathematics. Right now, I am focused on mastering linear algebra, including matrix operations and polynomial relationships. I apply these concepts to solve complex problems in computer architecture.
